# Protein-Lysine-Methylation-using-Convolution-Neural-Network-CNN

Lysine (Protein) methylation sites are identified accurately using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

Oversampling is implemented to handle the imbalanced data. Resulting balanced data set is pre-processed to normalize the samples.

Outliers are removed using Isolation Forest.

Principal Component Analysis is used for feature extraction.

Model is trained with CNN inspired by VGG-16 architecture using ReLU activation function and optimized using Adamâ€™s algorithm.

Classification results are enhanced using Bagging, a meta-learning technique.
